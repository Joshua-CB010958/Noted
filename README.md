# Noted
I designed a markdown note-taking application with a clean, responsive interface. The app features a split-pane editor with live Markdown preview using Marked.js, syntax highlighting for code blocks, and automatic note saving. The backend is implemented with Express and stores notes in a simple JSON file.

# More Function will added soon!
- Downloadable files
- fix light mode and dark mode

# Functionalities
- Notes are saved in Markdown and rendered as HTML
- Live preview as you type (thanks to Marked.js)
- Save notes in memory or a simple JSON file

# Tech stack
- Node.js
- Express
- Vue.js
- Marked.js

To use it simply install the zip file and first run the npm install command in the terminal then run npm run dev then you should be able to use it.
